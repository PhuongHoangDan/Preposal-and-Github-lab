Project’s name: Wynn Guest House

Based on the CS50x videos of web/HTML/Flask, I followed the instructions to create my first HTML page, and to install and run Flask on Python, which was a big struggle for a week. Then I tried to create an HTML page for the Guest House from scratch. This was another struggle: How I could make it as nicely as the pages on the internet. (I don’t think that I have the ability to beautifully design the page and make it look organized). Then my spouse came up with the idea that I should get free HTML template on the internet, explaining that my job is not to create HTML pages, but to know how to read them and make changes when needed. 

I used the pictures that I took for our guest house, uploaded on HTML pages, wrote descriptions for the rooms, and linked the pages together as I desired. (We were opening more rooms when I was doing the project!)

There are some details that I have not finished as I planned. I have not created the login page for guests nor made graphic graph about our income statement. 

After all, I know how to make HRML pages for our family’s business. Hopefully I can improve these pages in order to make a practical website for our growing business. 

P/S: I used HTML template from https://webdesignvista.com/.
