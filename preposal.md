# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My idea is to use Python to create a website about short-term renting. The website allows guests to register, choose and reserve available rooms. My family runs a renting business, and we use available platforms such as booking.com and airbnb. Why don't create my own website that has some similar functions!

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

None

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I have not created a website before, so the whole process is new to me. Can I use similar technique on the finance homework of the CS50? I need to start looking it up now.
