## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Wynn Guest House

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stock")

A website that allows guests to view, choose and reserve available rooms in a family business's Guest House. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use python to create related HTML sites. There will be a welcoming homepage, pictures of the house and the rooms, short description about the business, pages for each room with available dates to choose, register buttons.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None, this will be my first project relating to computer technology. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

none

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

There will be a welcoming homepage, short description about the business, buttons leading to different pages for each room with pictures of the rooms and register buttons.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will try to add one more feature like a sign-up page for registered guests, so they will receive a welcoming message with check-in instuctions after loging in.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope that I can input some income statements from Booking.com and make a graph to visualize how much we make during the months from the statements.

New skills that I need are how to write HTML, installing flask/venv/env packages for python (which gave me a hard time to find out),following the CS50x videos.
